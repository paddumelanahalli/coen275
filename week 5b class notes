Object-Oriented Analysis, Design, and Programming


Week 5b: Objects and Object-Oriented Concepts


I. Introduction (5 minutes)


Briefly introduce the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) and its importance.
Mention the key principles: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Modularity, Hierarchy, Typing, Concurrency, and Persistence.
Explain that OOA, OOD, and OOP are different but related stages in software development.

II. Objects and Classes (15 minutes)


Object Definition:
State: Attributes that describe the object.
Behavior: Methods (functions) that the object can perform.
Identity: A unique way to distinguish one object from another.
Class Definition:
A blueprint or template for creating objects.
Defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.
Instance: A specific object created from a class.
Example:
Class: Dog
Attributes: breed, age, color
Methods: bark(), eat(), sleep()
Instance: myDog (a specific dog object with its own breed, age, and color)

III. Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) (20 minutes)


Definition: Examining requirements from the perspective of classes and objects in the problem domain.
Purpose: To understand the problem and create a model of how the system should function.
Key Activities:
Identifying objects and classes.
Defining attributes and behaviors.
Modeling interactions between objects.
Techniques: Object Modeling, Dynamic Modeling, Functional Modeling (explained in detail later).
UML: Briefly introduce UML as a standard notation for visualizing and documenting software systems.

IV. Object-Oriented Design (OOD) (10 minutes)


Definition: The process of object-oriented decomposition and creating models of the system.
Purpose: To create a design that meets the requirements identified during OOA.
Models: Class diagrams, object diagrams, component diagrams, deployment diagrams (briefly mention these).

V. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (10 minutes)


Definition: Implementing the design as a collection of interacting objects.
Key Concepts (Recap):
Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods together within a class.
Inheritance: Creating new classes (child classes) based on existing classes (parent classes).
Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on many forms (method overloading and overriding).
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential information.

VI. Object Modeling (20 minutes)


Purpose: To develop the static structure of the software system.
Key Elements:
Objects
Classes (groupings of objects)
Relationships between objects
Attributes and operations of each class
Principles: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Modularity, Hierarchy, Typing, Concurrency, Persistence.
UML Class Diagrams: Briefly introduce how to represent classes, attributes, and methods in a UML class diagram.

VII. Dynamic Modeling (20 minutes)


Purpose: To model the behavior of the system over time.
Key Concepts:
States: Conditions or situations that an object can be in.
Events: Triggers that cause an object to transition from one state to another.
State Diagrams (Transition Diagrams): Visual representation of states and transitions.
Types of Events:
Signal Event: An external signal triggers the event (e.g., train departure).
Change Event: A change in a value triggers the event (e.g., battery power < 10%).
Time Event: A specific time or duration triggers the event (e.g., date = Jan 1st 2022).

VIII. Functional Modeling (15 minutes)


Purpose: To describe the processes performed within the system.
Focus: Data flow, actions, and data stores.
Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):
Graphical representation of how data moves through the system.
Shows inputs, outputs, and processes.
Use Cases: Briefly mention use cases as a way to describe how users interact with the system.

IX. Recap and Q&A (5 minutes)


Summarize the key concepts covered in the lecture.
Open the floor for questions.

Notes for Expansion:


Examples: Use real-world examples to illustrate each concept. For instance, when discussing inheritance, use the example of different types of vehicles inheriting from a base "Vehicle" class.
Diagrams: Include diagrams (UML class diagrams, state diagrams, DFDs) to visually represent the concepts.
C++ Code Snippets: While a full program is not here!, include small code snippets to demonstrate how to implement basic OOP concepts in C++. For example:


// Example of a simple class
class Dog {
public:
    string breed;
    int age;

    void bark() {
        cout << "Woof!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog myDog;
    myDog.breed = "Labrador";
    myDog.age = 3;
    myDog.bark(); // Output: Woof!
    return 0;
}

Activities: Incorporate short activities or thought experiments to engage students. For example:
"Think of a real-world object and list its attributes and behaviors."
"Draw a simple state diagram for a traffic light."

This expanded outline provides a solid foundation for creating comprehensive class notes on object-oriented analysis, design, and programming. Remember to tailor the content and examples to your specific audience and learning objectives.
